## Description

In this paper, our core work is to design a *Robust and Efficient Group Key Agreement Scheme Based on Cross-layer Design* to improve the success rate of group key agreement in UANET with unstable links. The implementation features an efficient **KeyGenerationTree** module that provides optimized key aggregation through binary tree structures, enabling faster convergence and reduced communication overhead.

These codes are to verify the performance of the proposed scheme. Specifically, we use three quantitative analyses that measure: (i) the group key agreement success rate, (ii) the group key agreement delay, (iii) the communication overhead, (iv) the key contribution propagation efficiency and (v) the group key agreement energy consumption.

> **Stochastic note** – Results involve random channel fading & gossip selection; absolute numbers may differ slightly from the paper, but **trends and relative gains remain stable**.

## Batch Testing Scripts

For convenience and reproducibility, we provide two automation scripts that handle large-scale experiments and result processing:

### allrun.sh - Batch Experiment Controller

The `allrun.sh` script is a comprehensive batch testing automation tool that systematically explores different simulation scenarios:

**Key Features:**

- **Multi-dimensional parameter sweep**: Automatically tests across 4 different area configurations (200×200×80m to 600×600×250m) and corresponding node density ranges (5-55 nodes)
- **Statistical robustness**: Runs 200 independent experiments per configuration to ensure statistical significance
- **Parallel execution**: Uses GNU `parallel` with 120 concurrent jobs for efficient resource utilization
- **Automated compilation**: Sets appropriate NS-3 compilation flags and logging levels

### Analyze.py - Results Processing Pipeline

The `Analyze.py` script provides a complete data processing and analysis pipeline:

**Processing Steps:**

1. **CSV Aggregation**: Merges all individual result files from `results_cache/` directory
2. **Database Conversion**: Converts merged CSV data to SQLite database for efficient querying
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Generates comprehensive Excel reports with multiple analysis sheets:
   - Success rate analysis by scenario
   - Key agreement delay statistics
   - Communication overhead metrics
   - Performance trends across different configurations

**Output Files:**

- `{timestamp}_Result.csv`: Consolidated raw experimental data
- `{timestamp}_experiment_results.db`: SQLite database for advanced queries
- `{timestamp}_analysis_results.xlsx`: Multi-sheet Excel report with statistical summaries

**Usage Example:**

```bash
# Run complete experimental suite
./allrun.sh           # Executes all experiments (may take several hours)

# Manual result processing (if needed)
python Analyze.py       # Aggregate and analyze results
```

> **Performance Note**: The full experimental suite involves ~7000 simulation runs. On a 112 multi-core server, expect 2-4 hours of execution time depending on hardware capabilities.

## NS3 Simulation Parameters

In our simulation experiment, to reflect optimal physical environments and channel conditions, the link quality is configured as **LOS** (Line of Sight) for wide-open rural/over-sea scenarios. The channel model incorporates a combination of the Friis model, log-distance path loss, Nakagami fading, and random shadowing models to comprehensively simulate multipath fading and shadowing effects in UANET. Relevant parameters are configured according to common UAV hardware settings.
